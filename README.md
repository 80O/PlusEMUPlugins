# PlusEMUPlugins
Collection of various plugins, maintained by the community. Single solution file with all plugin projects linked.

### Compiling
To compile the plugins, you need to have at least build Plus Emulator using MSBuild on windows as it will set the path to the dll file.

If you are on Linux or MacOS, you will have to add `PLUS_EMULATOR_HOME` to your environment variables so the emulator dll file can be found at compile time so no absolute or relative paths have to be specified in the `.csproj` file.
