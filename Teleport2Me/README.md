# Teleport 2 Me Plugin
A plugin for [Plus++ emulator](https://github.com/80O/PlusEMU). Teleports the specified user infront of you when you type :tptome %target%. Adds an additional argument "force" e.g. :tptome %target% force, which will force teleportation even though there's furniture infront of you.
